            Greetings and welcome to my website portfolio!

            I am delighted to have you here. <br> <br> At the age of 17, I am an ambitious and dedicated web developer
            with a
            proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and these skills have allowed me to craft captivating and
            dynamic websites that effectively communicate with users.

            <br>
            <br>
            Beyond the realm of coding, I find great solace and joy in maintaining an active lifestyle. Going to the gym
            has become more than just a hobby; it has become a vital part of my routine, fostering discipline, focus,
            and personal growth. In addition, I am an avid gamer, with Valorant being my favorite game. Exploring
            virtual worlds and engaging in thrilling gaming experiences fuels my creativity and provides a much-needed
            outlet for relaxation.
            <br>
            <br>
            My ultimate aspiration is to forge my own path and work independently. I am driven by the desire to be my
            own boss, to cultivate my skills, and to pursue freelance opportunities that grant me the freedom to express
            my creativity and push the boundaries of web development. This journey of self-improvement and
            entrepreneurial pursuit is what ignites my passion and fuels my determination.
            <br>
            <br>

            Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I invite you to browse through my projects, witness
            my dedication to craftsmanship, and join me on this exciting journey of growth and self-discovery.

          When it came to showcasing my color scheme and drawing inspiration from other portfolios,
          <br><br> I approached it with
          great enthusiasm. I carefully selected a harmonious color palette that reflected my personal style <br> and

                            Transforming a traditional board game into a digital platform was no easy task, but I
